# Single Model Optimization

For the MVP, we will need to orchestrate the workflow using just a single LLM model, loaded with all of the context compiled in the UI workflow builder. We need to consider how the model is processing context, where tokens are used, and how these can be managed to optimize performance.

If we can hyper-optimize the execution of one model at a time, then these same principles will be able to be applied to the multi-model architecture planned for later development.
